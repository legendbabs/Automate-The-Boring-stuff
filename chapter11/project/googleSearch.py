Whenever I search a topic on Google, I don’t look at just one search result
at a time. By middle-clicking a search result link (or clicking while holding
ctrl), I open the first several links in a bunch of new tabs to read later.
I search Google often enough that this workflow—opening my browser,
searching for a topic, and middle-clicking several links one by one—is
tedious. It would be nice if I could simply type a search term on the command
line and have my computer automatically open a browser with all
the top search results in new tabs. Let’s write a script to do this.
